## Python Week 6 README.md file


## Notes to remember what I did for this assignment

- Created a virtual environment using "python3 -m venv venv where I can install everything I need, keeping everything clean and organised
- Used terminal to esnure I am working in my python environment - source venv/bin/activate & installed PyInquirer [pip install PyInquirer]
- Created a requirments.txt file.  This lists all of the packages used within my python enviroment and their versions. Uselful if collaborating with others ensuring that we are all working with the same dependecies within a python project (packages & versions).
