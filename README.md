## Python Week 6 README.md file


## Notes to remember what I did for this assignment

- Created a virtual environment using "python3 -m venv venv where I can install everything I need, keeping everything clean and organised
- Used terminal to esnure I am working in my python environment - source venv/bin/activate & installed PyInquirer [pip install PyInquirer]
- Created a requirments.txt file.  This lists all of the packages used within my python enviroment and their versions. Uselful if collaborating with others ensuring that we are all working with the same dependecies within a python project (packages & versions).
- Created files and named them in a way that hopefully makes sense to me later ðŸ¤”.
- Created a list for Licences (following W3C)
- Planned and implemented prompt questions: define a **define a list of questions** and hand them to **prompt** [prompt returns a list of **answers**] (pypi.org)
    ðŸ’» using dictionaries in W3C to test
- Testing questions showed up an error that my version of Python would not work with PyInquirer, moved to InquirePy - change my queston syntax to name = inquirer.text(message="What's your name:").execute() (https://inquirerpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
